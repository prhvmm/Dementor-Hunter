# Dementor-Hunter
This is a basic game I wrote with java for a university project based on Harry Potter's theme. 
It has only three levels and three difficulties and a very basic graphic.
All objects in the game are in their own classes however dementors and their shots are in a same class. Game's setting is also in game class.
